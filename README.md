<h2>I am a Software Developer with over ten years IT, application analyst, and training experience. I bring out the best in teams I am involved with, helping complete business processes. I have college diploma in Web Development and freelanced as I started an IT career. I have decided I have a greater passion for software development and being customer facing I want to work on software that I love to solve problems and help people.</h2>
